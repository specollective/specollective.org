  description: >
    The Sustainable Progress and Equality Collective (SPEC) is an open learning organization that empowers individuals to be catalysts for positive change. Our mission is to empower individuals to become globally-minded change agents by helping them learn the essential skills required to build sustainable careers and make a positive impact in their communities. We aim to shape the next generation of leaders who will need to tackle the challenges facing their communities and the world at large. SPEC achieves this aim through research & development, mentorship, training, paid & unpaid research positions, and hosting events for people from underrepresented backgrounds, underserved communities, non-traditional backgrounds, and allies to the causes of environmental and social justice.

  We accomplish our goals through a combination of mentorship, upskilling, networking, and community-building in the areas of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion). We recruit and provide training in 21st Century skills to individuals from underrepresented backgrounds and host events with expert contributors and conduct research around these issues.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.

      Kaldi is the place to go if you want the best quality coffee. I love their
      stance on empowering farmers and transparency.

# Our Vision

Our vision is to accelerate sustainable development and build social equity through open collaborative innovation. We seek to train the next generation leaders and change makers, and incubate communities initiatives focused on creating positive social impact and protecting the environment. We take inspiration from the work of the renowned 20th century inventor and visionary Richard Buckminster Fuller. Fuller dedicated his life to creating systems that would enable people to live healthy and productive lives. He envisioned a "World Game", in which groups of experts collected and analyzed all the information and data available on the world's resources and industries. These teams would collaborate to develop sustainable solutions to global problems like poverty, homelessness, hunger, pandemics, and environmental destruction. Fuller's goal was, as he put it:

***"make the world work for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation without ecological offense or disadvantage of anyone."***

At SPEC, we believe that today humanity has the collective knowledge and technology to realize Fuller's vision. Modern computers enable distributed collaboration, information processing, and data analysis capabilities Fuller only could have dreamed of. We can use these technologies to build radically transparent, sustainable, and equal systems of living and working. If we can harness our collective intelligence and collaboratively innovate, we can make the world work for all people and the environment.

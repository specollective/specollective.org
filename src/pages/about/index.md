SPEC was founded in June 2020 when Dr. Rhianna Rogers and Joe Torreggiani joined forces to respond to the challenges of the pandemic and social injustice facing their communities. They connected online when Torreggiani posted an offer to provide mentoring, technical training, and micro-loans to individuals from underrepresented backgrounds, and Rogers reached out about collaborating.

The two discovered a shared mission to make a positive impact and alignment on core values. Prior to meeting, they had independently dedicated their careers and research to making a positive impact in the world. Rogers, an expert on cultural and ethnic studies, intercultural competencies and diversity education, cultural mediation, and virtual exchange programmatic development and implementation. Torreggiani, a senior software engineer, researcher, educator, environmentalist, and philanthropist. They co-founded SPEC to combine their knowledge, expertise, resources, and networks to expand their impact and advance environmental and social justice.
